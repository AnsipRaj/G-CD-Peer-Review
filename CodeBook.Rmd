## Description of Variables and steps taken to generate tidy data 

Section 1: Variables 

The variables in the final tidy data set- consist of all the features described the mean and standard devations of observations that were part of the experiment on wearable technology, and two additional vairables indtroduced during analysis. The two new variables are- 

subject- This variable recorded the subject that the observations corresponded to.A total of 30 subjects numbered from 1-30 were recroded. The variable has no units. It is merely a number assigned to a person. 
action- This variable recorded the the activity that teh subject undertook during the experiment.6 different activities were recorded. These are descriptive, character variables. The variable takes one of the follwing values 
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
LAYING
STANDING


These variables were present in the original UCI HAR Dataset. The Variables are the mean and standard deviation measures for the following in the original dataset.  
tBodyAcc XYZ
tGravityAcc XYZ
tBodyAccJerk XYZ
tBodyGyro XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc XYZ
fBodyAccJerk XYZ
fBodyGyro XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
   
Variables that start with t, refer to time domain signals, they were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz
Variables that start with f, refer to frequency domain signals, these were computed using a Fast Fourier Transform
Variables that contain the term Acc, correspond to measurements of linear acceleration which is measured with a device called an accelerometer 
Variables that contain the term Gyro, correspond to measurements of angular velocity which is measured with a device called an gyroscope
Acceleration and Gyro signals were fed into a low pass filter to generate body and gravity signals that are represented by Body and Gravity, repectively
Variables that contain the terms Jerk and Mag, refer to the measurements of the magnitude and jerk signals
All the measures were calculated for the X, Y and Z axes 
Some variables erroneously contained the word 'Body', twice. This mistake was corrected.

The above information was used to create simple names for the variables in the tidy dataset. The final variables names are:

A total of 68 variables are present in the tidy dataset

The second dataset was prepared by calculating the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity. This is the dataset that is available in the repository


Section 2: Transformation

Most of the transformations that were to to generate the tidy data, involved combining the information in the various files present in the UCI HAR Dataset folder. The following steps were taken to generate the tidy data 

1. The subjectname and subjectact columns were appended to the test and train dataset, based on thier values in the subject_test.txt and y_test.txt files 
2. The Test and Train sets were merged using rbind 
3. The variables in the combined dataset were named using the names provided in the features_info.txt file 
4. The columns that contained mean and standard devaiation data were chosen through the grep() command. Variables that recorded the mean frequency were also included 
5. Descriptive names for the activities were provided based on description in the activity_labels.txt file
6. The mean for each subject for each activity was calculated for all variables using the melt() and dcast() functions
